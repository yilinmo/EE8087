<h2 id="org88dc731"> Spherical Earth</h2>
<p>
Pythagoras (about 500 BC) provides the earliest arguments for why the Earth is round. The moon, he noted, was also a sphere, so it would follow that the Earth is round as well.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2> Spherical Earth</h2>

<p>
Aristotle (about 340 BC) supported the idea of a spherical Earth, Moon and planets because:  
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the sphere is a perfect solid and the heavens are a region of perfection</li>
<li>the Earth's component pieces, falling naturally towards the centre, would press into a round form</li>
<li>in an eclipse of the Moon, the Earth's shadow is always circular: a flat disc would cast an oval shadow</li>
<li>even in short travels northwards the Pole Star is higher in the sky.</li>
<li>ships sailing over the horizon disappear hull first</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="org5ae5dde"> How Far is the Horizon?</h2>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A man is standing on a \(h=30m\) building at point \(P\).</li>
<li>Assume the Earth is a perfect sphere with radius \(R=6371km\).</li>
<li>Draw the tangent line from \(P\) to the circle.</li>
<li>\(OP = R + h\), \(OQ = R\), and \(\angle OQP = 90^\circ\).</li>
<li>\(QP = \sqrt{(R+h)^2 - R^2} = \sqrt{2Rh+h^2}\approx \sqrt{2Rh} = 19.55km\).</li>

<h2> Size of the Earth</h2>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>His Calculation is based on the following assumptions:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>That the distance between Alexandria and Syene was 5000 stadia,</li>
<li>That Alexandria is due north of Syene</li>
<li>That Syene lies on the Tropic of Cancer</li>
<li>That the Earth is a perfect sphere.</li>
<li>That light rays emanating from the Sun are parallel.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>His calculation has an error of 10%, which is remarkably accurate.</li>
<li>He is also famous for inventing the Sieve of Eratosthenes, an algorithm to find all prime numbers up to a given limit.</li>

<h2> Columbus</h2>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The size of the earth were known to the panel of experts which King Ferdinand appointed to examine the proposal made by Columbus.</li>
<li>They turned Columbus down, because using the original value by Eratosthenes, they calculated how far India was to the west of Spain, and concluded that the distance was far too great.</li>
<li>Columbus had an estimate of his own, which severely underestimate the size of the Earth.</li>
<li>In the end Queen Isabella overruled the experts, and the rest is history.</li>

<h2 id="orgaf88587"> Lunar Eclipse</h2>
<p>Aristarchus of Samos uses Lunar eclipse to calculate the distance of the moon to the earth.</p>

</section>

<section>
<h2> Lunar Eclipse</h2>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>His calculation is based on the following steps:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>the Moon moved in a large circle around Earth with the same speed. Let \(R\) be the radius and \(T\) be its period.</li>
<li>An eclipse of the Moon occurs when the Moon passes through the shadow of the Earth. The shadow is a cylinder with width \(2r\), where \(r\) is the radius of the earth.</li>
<li>The duration of a total lunar eclipse is \(t\).</li>
<li>Therefore \[2\pi R / T = 2r /t,\] from which Aristarchus obtained \(R \approx 60 r\), which is astonishingly accurate to what we know today \(R = 60.32 r\).</li>
</ol></li>
</section>

<section>
<h2> Lunar Eclipse</h2>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>However, the calculation is not entirely correct since
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>He uses the synodic period of \(29.5\) days, not the orbital period \(27.32\).</li>
<li>The shadow of the Earth is actually a cone instead of cylinder. The width of the shadow is roughly \(25%\) narrower than \(2r\) at the orbit of the moon.</li>

<h2> Parallax</h2>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We can use parallax to determine the distance to the moon.</li>
<li>The angle \(\angle QPO\) is called lunar parallax, which is roughly \(1/2\) the apparent angle between Star 1 and 2.</li>
<li>The distance to the moon can be computed as \[\frac{r}{\sin\angle QPO}\approx \frac{r}{\angle QPO}.\]</li>

<h2 id="org385c450"> Aristarchus' Method</h2>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Aristarchus of Samos proposed to used half moon to measure the distance.</li>
<li>He claimed that during a half moon, the moon forms a right triangle with the Sun and Earth.</li>
<li>By observing the angle between the Sun and Moon, \(\phi\), we know that \[\frac{L}{S} = \cos\phi\approx \frac{\pi}{2}-\phi.\]</li>
<li>He measured \(\phi = 87^\circ\) and hence our distance to the sun is 20 times greater than our distance to the moon.</li>
<li>This value (or values close to it) was accepted by astronomers for the next two thousand years</li>
<li>However, it is roughly \(1/20\) of the true value.</li>

<h2 id="orgb80c5fc"> Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion</h2>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The distance between the Earth and the Sun is called <i>the Astronomical Unit</i> or AU for short.</li>
<li>The square of the orbital period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. \[r\propto T^{2/3}.\]</li>
<li>Given the orbital period of Jupiter to be 11.862 year. The semi-major axis of the orbit is \[11.862^{2/3} = 5.20 AU.\]</li>
<li>The Astronomical Unit is the ruler for astronomers.</li>
<li>We can measure everything in terms of AU. However, how large is 1 AU?</li>

<li>It is non-trivial to measure solar parallax since it is only \(8''.79\), roughly 1/400 of the lunar parallax.</li>
<li>A transit of Venus across the Sun takes place when the planet Venus passes directly between the Sun and a superior planet. </li>

<li>The next transits of Venus will take place on 10â€“11 December 2117, and 8 December 2125.</li>

<h2> Transit of Venus</h2>
<ul class="org-ul">

<li>Hallye died in 1742, before seeing the next transit in 1761.</li>
<li>Observing the transits in 1761 and 1769 was an unprecedented international scientific operation. Dozens of astronomers were dispatched to observing points around the world at great expense and personal danger: several of them died in the endeavour. The various results were collated by JÃ©rÃ´me Lalande to give a figure for the solar parallax of 8.6â€³.
</li>

<li>Direct radar measurements of the distances to Venus and Mars became available in the early 1960.</li>
<li>Using speed of light, we can deduce the length of the astronomical unit accurately.</li>

<li>However, the Earth is not large enough as the base line.</li>
<li>The orbit of the Earth is leveraged instead.</li>
<li>The parsec is defined as the distance to the star whose parallax is \(1''\), which is roughly \[1\text{AU}\times \frac{\pi}{180\times 60\times 60} = 206264 \text{AU} =3.26 \text{Light Year}.\]</li>

<h2 id> Brightness of a Star</h2>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For stars, we know that the further away it is from the earth, the dimmer it becomes. The apparent brightness follows the inverse square law.</li>
<li>Apparent magnitude \(m\) is the magnitude of the star measured from Earth.</li>
<li>Absolute magnitude \(M\) is the magnitude of the star measured at \(10\) parsecs away from the star: \[m - M = 5(\log_{10} d-1).\]</li>

<h2 id> Brightness of a Star</h2>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The sun is 1 AU or \(\pi/648000\) parsecs away from us and has an apparent magnitude of \(-26.74\). Therefore, the absolute magnitude of the sun is \[M = -26.74 - 5 (\log_{10} (\pi/648000)-1) = 4.83.\]</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The Great Debate was held on 26 April 1920 at the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History, between the astronomers Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis.</li>
<li>Shapley was arguing in favor of the Milky Way as the entirety of the then known universe.</li>
<li>Curtis on the other side contended that Andromeda and other such "nebulae" were separate galaxies.</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Edwin Hubble identified Cepheid variables in the Andromeda (0.78 million parsecs away) and other "nebula".</li>
